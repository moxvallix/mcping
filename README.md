# MCPing

Simple Plasmoid to display how many players are on a given Minecraft server.

See when other players are online from the comfort of your panel or desktop.

Right now, the `mcping-rs` binary this plasmoid ships with is only compiled for x86_64, so its unlikely this will work with other architectures.
